Search - dump("SeBa - on dstar/starclass/double_star.C
Remove all the - dump("SeBa - lines

Go to sstar/starclass/single_star.C and do the same

This stops all output to SeBa.data

Then go to SeBa.C and search for - dump("SeBa -

There are 2 of them. Split them into 'input' and 'output'

The SeBa output/input has also been modified in double_star.C file (funtcion -- void double_star::dump(ostream & s, bool brief))

column 1 binary identity number 
column 2 binary type
column 3 time
column 4 separation in Solar radii
column 5 & 10 stellar identity number (either 0 or 1)
column 6 & 11 star type
column 7 & 12 stellar mass in Solar mass
column 8 & 13 stellar radius in Solar radii
column 9 & 14 log of effective temperature

# MAKE SeBa
make clean && make && cd dstar && make && cd ..

"01" creates the coordinates and distances for binaries in the galaxy and creates shell scripts to simulate the binary evolution
To generate SeBa binaries, run "sbatch 99_slurm/py_LSST_SeBa_GenerateSimulateDWDFormation.slurm.script"
This uses the generated script to simulate binaries using SeBa and stores it scratch directory.
Then notebook "02" collects the simulated result and creates a collection of binaries
Then "03" distributes the binaries across the galaxy and assigns mock LSST photometry
